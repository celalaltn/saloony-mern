- **Data consistency** - ACID transactions within documents
- **Query efficiency** - can join related data in single queries
- **Backup simplicity** - single database to backup and restore
- **Development speed** - no distributed data management complexity

### Caching Strategy
**Redis for multiple purposes**:
- **Session storage** - JWT refresh tokens
- **Job queues** - background task processing
- **Application cache** - frequently accessed data
- **Rate limiting** - API request throttling

## Security Considerations

### Authentication Security
- **JWT short expiration** - 15-minute access tokens
- **Refresh token rotation** - new refresh token on each use
- **Password hashing** - bcrypt with salt rounds
- **Rate limiting** - prevent brute force attacks

### Data Protection
- **Input validation** - Yup schemas on frontend and backend
- **SQL injection prevention** - Mongoose ODM parameterized queries
- **XSS protection** - Content Security Policy headers
- **CORS configuration** - restrict cross-origin requests

### Payment Security

- **Environment variables** - sensitive keys not in code

## Scalability Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling
- **Stateless API** - can run multiple server instances
- **Redis clustering** - can scale job processing
- **MongoDB sharding** - can partition data across servers
- **CDN integration** - static assets served from edge locations

### Performance Optimization
- **Database indexing** - optimized queries for appointments and customers
- **API pagination** - limit data transfer for large datasets
- **Image optimization** - Cloudinary for profile pictures and service images
- **Caching layers** - Redis for frequently accessed data

## Cost Optimization

### Infrastructure Costs
- **MongoDB Atlas** - managed database with automatic scaling
- **Heroku/Railway** - simple deployment with reasonable pricing
- **Redis Cloud** - managed Redis with free tier
- **Cloudinary** - image storage with generous free tier
